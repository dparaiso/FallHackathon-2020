# FallHackathon-2020

We created a program called "Grow Old" which goes with the acronym "GO"
the purpose is to create an interactive program similar to bitLife Simulator

Instructions: 
1. Run the program on repl.it for c++ 
2. Follow the flow of the program and answer the question accordingly
3. Answer the questions until you are deemed dead
